        <p>
          These have been trying times. With our lives being busier than ever, forgetting those we love and cherish has
          become a regrettable norm. If we could visualize the links between us and how far they've grown, coming
          together could seem the new norm.

        <h2>What is In-Touch?</h2>
        <p>
          Developed by students attending Brooklyn College, In-Touch is an excercise in interconnectivity. Designed from
          the ground up with an ever changing model, to visualize our interactions with those close to us.
